Which medal whould I obtain it???</p><p>All this questions I answerd it for myself during the exam itself, so the exam was about Big Data, Storage and Cloud Services. We was provied with a syllabus for each concept we should study, and the structure og the exam was about 90 points between MCQ, T or F and Select More Than One, during the exam I was have much confident when I select an answer of the question, the time of the exam was 3 hours and I finished it in 2.44 hours, then I submitted my answers and go away, I also want to mention that the exam hold in 3 different places related to Huawei Egypt and it&#x27;s not from home.</p><p>Two weeks ago I&#x27;ve received a call Huawei Egypt Team, told me that I was one from the top 9 students of cloud track, when I heard thi news I was so excited because this was good things from me because the top 9 students gonna recieve so much opportunity related to our future career and we also have an oppotunity to reach the final in China. I&#x27;m so happy to be from 9 student, I know now that I have to do my best pass the the selection exam and so much work to reach China final, so I hope I edit the article again when I achieve something bigger and move forward to next phase, I can&#x27;t wait, guys and see you later ðŸ‘‹</p></section></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><nav class="pagination-nav"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/2020/02/25/a-week-with-innovegypt"><h5 class="pagination-nav__link--sublabel">Next Post</h5><h4 class="pagination-nav__link--label">A Week with InnovEgypt Â»</h4></a></div></nav></div></div></div></div></div>
