In October 2019, I heard a lot about a competition by Huawei, it's a big competiton around thr world and a lot of students took part in it every year, and I also heard that one student from my university participated in it last year, and he had  gotten the gold medal, so I told myself that I have to take part in it especially that the competition had two tracks one for the network track and the other for the cloud track which I liked it and participated in it so let tell what happened with me.

When I determinded that I gonna participate in this competition, I immediately signed up on Huawei competiton site, and I also downloaded the Huawei app of online learning it called "iLearningX", about this app it's very useful, it has so many free courses for networks and cloud computing, it will you prepare will for the Huawei certification exams, so I encourage everyonr to give it a shot and try it. back to the competition, it has five phases, the first phase, it's for qualifying the best 500 students from all universities in Egypt, and the 500 students will have a national exam to select 200 stidents from the 2 tracks to win medals and this the second phase, then from the 200 the top 9 students from each track will have a selection exam to qualify the best 3 students of each track through the North Africa and the Final in China.

For Me I've passed the first phase with a good score, so now I'm in the second phase of national exam, On March 7, 2020 it was the day of the national exam, I was asking myself... were I prepared enough to pass this exam??? if the answer is yes. Which medal whould I obtain it???

All this questions I answerd it for myself during the exam itself, so the exam was about Big Data, Storage and Cloud Services. We was provied with a syllabus for each concept we should study, and the structure og the exam was about 90 points between MCQ, T or F and Select More Than One, during the exam I was have much confident when I select an answer of the question, the time of the exam was 3 hours and I finished it in 2.44 hours, then I submitted my answers and go away, I also want to mention that the exam hold in 3 different places related to Huawei Egypt and it's not from home.

Two weeks ago I've received a call Huawei Egypt Team, told me that I was one from the top 9 students of cloud track, when I heard thi news I was so excited because this was good things from me because the top 9 students gonna recieve so much opportunity related to our future career and we also have an oppotunity to reach the final in China. I'm so happy to be from 9 student, I know now that I have to do my best pass the the selection exam and so much work to reach China final, so I hope I edit the article again when I achieve something bigger and move forward to next phase, I can't wait, guys and see you later ðŸ‘‹
