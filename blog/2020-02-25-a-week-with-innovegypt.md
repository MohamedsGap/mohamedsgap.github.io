*** Note *** I wrote this post when I finished the training back in _August 10, 2019_ so the date of _*Feburary 25, 2020*_ When I decied to create a new blog section on my personal website and write some blog post like this so I'd like this post to be the first one so I hope you enjoy it!

I met new friends there, We also worked on different projects together it was a very cool collaboration with these amazing people, This training was divided into three phases, First phase was about “Introduction to innovation and technology management” in this phase the instructor talked about how to deal with innovation and how to manage the new technology, we worked on a project related to mind map how to get benefits from this technique.

The second phase was “Ideation Camp” I think this phase was an absolute great, I have learned how to think in different ways as my usual, how to deal with brainstorming how it very useful in some situations, I also learned how to listen to people, how to present my idea in perfect way, we have an intro to pitching.
 
The third phase was about “entrepreneurship” I think this phase was outstanding and very useful for all students who attended this training, the instructor give us an introduction to Entrepreneurship, how to build a team, how to move forward to achieve our goals, how to deal with idea and got it into new startup, in the last day we made a presentation about my project that we have working on it since day 3 of the training. 

We made our presentation in front of all students, I think we did well, our project was about helping the students to access books, syllabus, papers research easier than ever, it’s a very powerful app with a huge benefits for all students, at the end I really thank everyone I have worked with during this training and everyone I talked, all students were amazing, helpful and friendly, I really encourage to take part in this training if possible, it was a very great week.
